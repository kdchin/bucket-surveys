I converted to a percent. (r1_BucketInterp)


Percent (r2_BucketInterp)


Converted it to a percent. it should be an actual grade. the labels are confusing (r3_BucketInterp)


proficient was interpreted as a percentage, close to 100% essentially (r4_BucketInterp)


Converted to percent. (r5_BucketInterp)


I converted it to the percentage so that I would be able to calculate our final grade on the checkpoint given the projected other grades (r6_BucketInterp)


I intepreted it as is. (r7_BucketInterp)


I converted it to percent scale. Because I cared about how much it was worth in terms of my total grade. (r8_BucketInterp)

I converted it to a % (r11_BucketInterp)


i converted it to a percentage (r12_BucketInterp)


I interpreted it as the bucket label, except for Extending which remained 100% in my mind. (r13_BucketInterp)




we interpreted it as the stopping point - we did think about the rough grade range for each bucket and what that meant for our grades but we aimed for Proficiency on every checkpoint (r14_BucketInterp)


percentage. (r15_BucketInterp)


Percent (r16_BucketInterp)


Incomplete if below Extending (r17_BucketInterp)

Converted to percent, treated it as the lower bound on the score. (r24_BucketInterp)


Interpret as is in bucket scale. We wanted to get to 100%. (r25_BucketInterp)


Sometimes, when we were stuck and unsure if would be able to reach the next bucket we'd look up the percentage to determine if we should spend more time on it (r26_BucketInterp)


I converted it to a percent. (r27_BucketInterp)


No, just developed until proficient. (r28_BucketInterp)

I interpret the label as the percent. (r29_BucketInterp)


really my goal was always just to get proficient.  I always thought of it as a percentage and would only be happy with a proficient. (r30_BucketInterp)

I converted it to percentage. (r48_BucketInterp)


I will just interpret the label as is as our goal is only proficient (r49_BucketInterp)


None - I didn't really think about it. (r50_BucketInterp)


'- We interpreted the label as is. (r51_BucketInterp)


We interpreted it as-is *but* in full knowledge that Proficient was our goal and anything less was a steep downgrade in grades. (r52_BucketInterp)


We tried it as is. We did not translate to a percent. (r53_BucketInterp)


I interpreted it as whatever the bucket score conversion was (ie what shows up on classy) (r54_BucketInterp)


I interpreted it as is, but not really by the descriptor more by what it's relative level was (i.e. beginning is the lowest level, developing is almost done) (r55_BucketInterp)


Converted. (r56_BucketInterp)


I converted it mentally to a percentage to know how good I was doing in that given phase. (r57_BucketInterp)


I always tried to convert it to a percentage, which is why it would have been helpful if it was a percentage to start with. (r58_BucketInterp)


our group converted it to a percentage ie; proficient in one means 100 in that bucket. (r59_BucketInterp)


Our goal was always to get to Proficient. We would convert and interpret Proficient as 100 percent. However, for submissions that did not attain this bucket, we didn't bother thinking about converting anything. We largely saw these phases at transitory on the way to the goal (r60_BucketInterp)


Neither, I only aimed for proficiency. (r61_BucketInterp)


Converted to percent. (r62_BucketInterp)

i converted it to a percentage of the lowest bucket grading in that label (r73_BucketInterp)


Converted it to a percent. (r74_BucketInterp)


Converted it into a percent. (r75_BucketInterp)


Both, since it told me where I was at, and was told there was an equivalent bucket grade. (r76_BucketInterp)


I interpreted any bucket other than proficient on the code portion as meaning I am not done yet. (r77_BucketInterp)


I interpreted it as in the bucket scale. Without seeing how many tests were failing behind the scenes, I don't know how I could've converted it. (r78_BucketInterp)


as a bucket scale (r79_BucketInterp)


I converted it to a point scale (r80_BucketInterp)


Convert to percentage (r81_BucketInterp)

Tried hard to convert it to % (r97_BucketInterp)


I interpreted it as bucket scale. (r98_BucketInterp)

Converted it to percentage (r106_BucketInterp)


to point scale (r107_BucketInterp)


We interpreted it as is, because that method of grading made us think about the grading less (r108_BucketInterp)


I only consider autograded programming assignments to be done when I hit 100, so for me, it remained a binary done/not done (r109_BucketInterp)


I interpreted it as a letter grade scale where Beginning was F, Acquiring was C, Developing was B and Proficient/ Extending was A. (r110_BucketInterp)


I convert to percent to determine my grade for the checkpoint (r111_BucketInterp)


convert to percentage (r112_BucketInterp)


as is (r113_BucketInterp)

Both, as is but also a percent as well. (r141_BucketInterp)


bucket scale (r142_BucketInterp)


I would leave it as a label. (r143_BucketInterp)


when we got developing because one bug, we did not consider it to actually mean "developing". We considered it something more like "derailed" or "disrupted" and treated it as a 0% in our head. As far as we were concerned our code was proficient but there was a spec misread somewhere (r144_BucketInterp)


Percent (r145_BucketInterp)


we converted it to the percent equivalent. (r146_BucketInterp)

I interpreted it as is. (r181_BucketInterp)


I'm not sure what you mean by interpreting the label as is? Because in my head, I thought of everything as the bucket scale; but I didn't think about the names to represent where I was, if you understand what I mean. Like in my head, I was shooting for proficient because that means max marks, not that proficient represents my progress. (r182_BucketInterp)

Percentage since that is what will be put in the grade book. (r196_BucketInterp)


I interpreted the label as is (r197_BucketInterp)


kept it bucket (r198_BucketInterp)

converted to percentage (r209_BucketInterp)


I used the percent to bucket label conversion we were given on the website. (r210_BucketInterp)

We converted it to a percentage (r222_BucketInterp)


Convert it to a point scale (r223_BucketInterp)


As is. (r224_BucketInterp)


For us, the goal was always to reach at least Developing since we knew it was an 80%. Then, in the interest of time, we would decide if we wanna try for proficient or even extending. We would therefore usually not convert before reaching Developing. (r225_BucketInterp)


As is. (r226_BucketInterp)

I didn’t really think about it (r234_BucketInterp)


I didn't convert it, just interpreted it as the bucket (r235_BucketInterp)


As is (r236_BucketInterp)


When my deliverable was assigned a bucket label, I typically interpreted the label within the bucket scale and then converted it to a percentage scale for better clarity and comparison.

Convert to percentage that the bucket belongs to. (r244_BucketInterp)


Interpreted as is. Goal was always to get to proficient. (r245_BucketInterp)


well we aimed to be proficient in each checkpoint so for us it was just a measure of whether we are meeting our goal or not. (r246_BucketInterp)


I interpret the label as what it is. (r247_BucketInterp)


I converted it to the maximum percentage i.e proficient being 100% (r248_BucketInterp)


Yes we would think of it in percentage (r249_BucketInterp)


As is (r250_BucketInterp)

I convert it to a percentage (r263_BucketInterp)


I would convert it to a rough percentage if I was confident the number of smoke tests passing was at the highest grade cutoff for that bucked. Other times, I would just see it as a label. (r264_BucketInterp)


I converted it to a percentage as listed on the course website (the names of the buckets themselves meant nothing to me) (r265_BucketInterp)


I converted it to percentages. (r266_BucketInterp)


We converted to a percentage scale. (r267_BucketInterp)


I interpret the label as in the bucket scale. (r268_BucketInterp)

always as a %. i saw developing as 80% and proficient as full or 100% (r271_BucketInterp)


I interpreted it as is. (r272_BucketInterp)

I interpreted it as is (r274_BucketInterp)


Proficient was 80% and everything below was under 80% and everything above was above 80%. (r275_BucketInterp)
